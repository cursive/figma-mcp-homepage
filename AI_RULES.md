# AI Rules for this Project

## Component Development Rules
1. Build exactly what the user asks for - no more, no less
2. Don't add "polish" or "improvements" without asking first
3. If I think something might be useful, ask the user first
4. Stick to the minimal working version unless explicitly requested otherwise
5. Let the user make design decisions, not me

## Figma MCP Workflow
1. Only pull changes when user explicitly asks
2. Update code to match Figma exactly
3. Don't add features not present in Figma design
4. Ask before making any assumptions about styling or behavior
